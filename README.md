# Add some falling leaves to your website
This code _(leaves.js)_ works in chain with index.html, styles.css and images in img folder.

# Changing leaves behaviour in leaves.js file:
- **wind speed** and **direction** and **fall speed** (variables wind and fallSpeed at the beggining of the code);
- **div inside wich leaves will appear**, by changing name of string id that by default is 'animation-div' or if code did not find one - html tag itself;
- **interval of wind changing direction** by changing second parameter in first setInterval function;
- **leafs amount** by changing condition in first for loop for leaf variable;

# **You can freely change and use code in your projets**
